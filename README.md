Convert PGN chess moves to Unicode figurine notation with English and Greek output.

A simple tool for converting chess game moves (PGN format) into Unicode figurine notation. It supports output in both English and Greek and is ideal for chess coaches, writers, and content creators who work with educational material.

The program removes headers and extracts only the move text. It replaces piece letters with proper figurines and works with both White and Black pieces (something that fonts alone cannot achieve).

Available as:
- Windows `.exe` (double-click to run)
- Linux `.AppImage` (no installation required)
